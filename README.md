# bond_and_swap

The purpose of this repository is to give the necessary tools (functions and classes) to value complex fixed income, credit, inflation and hybrid instruments (derivatives/
structured products). 

We start by valuation of bonds with interest rate risk (under interest rate models) and credit risk. 

We will push on by valuing with bond with different features:
--call, put/conversion provisions
--different coupon/notional payment structures

Swaps: interest rate, credit, currency, inflaxion, index, equity and hybrid
